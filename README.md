## What is get_next_line ?

get_next_line is an individual project at [19](https://www.s19.be/)/[42](https://www.42.fr/) that basically reads a file line by line.

Disclaimer: *There are so many easier methods of doing this by using standard C functions. But the goal here is to be able to do it by using any functions from my libft and only the standard functions* ```read```, ```malloc``` and ```free```.
